Mausezahn is a **fast traffic generator** written in C which allows you
to send nearly every possible and impossible packet.
Mausezahn can be used:

 - As traffic generator (e. g. to stress multicast networks)
 - For penetration testing of firewalls and IDS
 - For DoS attacks on networks (for audit purposes of course)
 - To find bugs in network software or appliances
 - For reconnaissance attacks using ping sweeps and port scans
 - To test network behaviour under strange circumstances (stress test,
   malformed packets, ...)
 - As didactical tool during lab exercises

Mausezahn is basically a versatile packet creation tool on the command line 
with a simple syntax and online help. It could also be used within (bash-) 
scripts to perform combination of tests.

Mausezahn requires libnet and libcli.
