Vidalia is a GUI for the Tor software. Using Vidalia, you can start and stop 
the Tor software, view its status at a glance, and monitor bandwidth usage. 
Vidalia also makes it easy to contribute to the Tor network by helping you 
set up and manage your own relay.

See README.SBo (which is also installed with the package docs) for some 
configuration hints.

Vidalia requires tor.
