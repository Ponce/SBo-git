Bakefile is cross-platform, cross-compiler native makefiles generator. 
It takes compiler-independent description of build tasks as input and 
generates native makefile (autoconf's Makefile.in, Visual C++ project, 
bcc makefile etc.).

Bakefile's task is to generate native makefiles, so that people can keep 
using their favorite tools. There are other cross-platform make solutions, 
but they either aren't native and require the user to use unfamiliar tools 
(Boost.Build) or they are too limited (qmake).
