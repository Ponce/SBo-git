cvsd is a wrapper program for cvs in pserver mode. it will run 'cvs pserver'
under a special uid/gid in a chroot jail.

cvsd is run as a daemon and is controlled through a configuration file. It is
relatively easy to configure and provides tools for easy setting up a chroot
jail.

This server can be useful if you want to run a public cvs pserver. You should
however be aware of the security limitations of running a cvs pserver. If you
want any kind of authentication you should really consider using secure shell
as a secure authentication mechanism and transport. Passwords used in cvs
pserver are transmitted in plain text.

This wrapper adds a layer of security to the cvs server. cvs is a very
powerful tool and is capable of running scripts and other things. Running cvs
in a chroot jail it is possible to limit the amount of "damage" cvs can do if
it is exploited. It is generally a good idea to run cvsd without any write
permissions to any directory on the system.

Features of cvsd include:
 * running in chroot jail
 * configuring chroot jail
 * running under a non-root uid
 * set a nice value
 * limit resource usage
 * limit number of connections
 * relatively easy to set up
