# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libnice: libnice (The GLib ICE implementation)
libnice:
libnice: Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactice 
libnice: Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based
libnice: library, libnice and GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for 
libnice: applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams.
libnice: It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security
libnice: against some attacks.  Existing standards that use ICE include
libnice: include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
