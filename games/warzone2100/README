This is an improved version of Warzone 2100, a 3D science fiction 
real time strategy game developed by Pumpkin Studios and published 
by Eidos Interactive in 1999. 
 
Warzone 2100 offers campaign, tutorial, multi-player and single-player 
skirmish game modes, unit designer, unit experience system, and everything 
you would expect from a modern RTS game.

The release is network incompatible with previous versions, which means you 
cannot play multiplayer games with previous versions of Warzone.  Skirmish 
savegames from past games also do NOT work on this release.

This requires physfs, quesoglc, and OpenAL.
