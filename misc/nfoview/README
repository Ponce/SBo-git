NFO Viewer is a simple viewer for NFO files, which are "ASCII" art
in the CP437 codepage. The advantages of using NFO Viewer instead
of a text editor are preset font and encoding settings, automatic
window size and clickable hyperlinks.

Note: The preferences dialog does not display due to the outdated
GTK+ in Slackware 13.0.
