The scope of this package is to define an API in line with the current Java(tm)
Platform APIs to support an alternative invocation mechanism which could be
used instead of the above mentioned public static void main(String[]) method.
This specification cover the behavior and life cycle of what we define as
Java(tm) daemons, or, in other words, non interactive Java(tm) applications.

commons-daemon requires apache-ant and jdk from /extra at build-time.
