SQLite is a small C library that implements a self-contained, embeddable, 
zero-configuration SQL database engine.  The distribution contains a 
standalone command-line database access program as well.

This is a legacy build that is no longer maintained or supported by the 
upstream developers at sqlite.org.  This sqlite2 package can be installed
in parallel with the sqlite (version 3) package included in Slackware.
