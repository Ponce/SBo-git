Ranger: A keeper, guardian, or soldier who ranges over a region to
protect the area or enforce the law. 

This is the filemanager Chuck Norris the Texas Ranger would use if he
had a computer with a unix-like operating system. (He doesn't trust
computers though and prefers to do the calculations himself.) 

After all, as a professional ranger, he needs a broad overview of his
territory, and the multi-column display of ranger provides just that,
rather than restricting you to the current directory only. You can
preview the content of the selected file or directory, copy or move
files around with the VIM-like commands dd and yy, execute predefined
applications when opening a file, etc... 

Everything is fully customizable and written in Python (2.6 and 3.1
compatible) using curses for the text-based user interface.
