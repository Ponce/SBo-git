xmobar (A Minimalistic Text Based Status Bar)

It was designed to work with the xmonad Window Manager.

It was inspired by the Ion3 status bar, and supports similar features,
like dynamic color management, output templates, and extensibility 
through plugins.

This requires ghc, haskell-X11, haskell-X11-xft, haskell-mtl, haskell-stm,
haskell-parsec, and haskell-hinotify.

haskell-xmonad-contrib is recommended.
